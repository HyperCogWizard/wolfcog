# WolfCog AGI-OS

🐺 **WolfCog** is a symbolic operating system designed as the meta-root for AGI (Artificial General Intelligence). Built on a Guix/Guile foundation, it implements a trinitized OS model with geometric memory structures and contextual grammars running inside a recursive AGI ecology.

Perfect for assembling the **meta-root of a symbolic OS** using **Guix/Guile** as the bootstrap layer—a **fully reproducible, Lisp-native substrate** that integrates cleanly into a symbolic AGI runtime.


## Key Features

🔧 **Guix + Guile-based symbolic bootstrap** - Fully reproducible environment
🐺 **WolfKernels and symbolic services** - Multi-kernel symbolic architecture  
🔗 **LibraryLinkUtils, GitLink, CascadeLink** - Advanced integration layers
🧠 **OpenCog interfacing** - AtomSpace symbolic memory integration
🧬 **Symbolic evolution engine** - Self-modifying and self-improving capabilities

## Quick Start

### 1. Bootstrap the AGI-OS Environment

```bash
# Enter the WolfCog AGI-OS environment
guix shell -m .guix/manifest.scm

# Run Stage0 AGI-OS bootstrap sequence
guile .guix/bootstrap/stage0.scm

# Or interactive bootstrap shell
guile .guix/bootstrap/init-shell.scm
```

The Stage0 bootstrap implements:
- **Wolfram Kernel Pool Detection**: Automatic discovery and configuration
- **OpenCog Unified Integration**: CogUtil, AtomSpace, CogServer loading
- **ASFS Initialization**: AtomSpace FileSystem mounting
- **Security Enforcement**: Guix-inspired declarative constraints  
- **Adaptive Attention**: Cognitive resource allocation

### 2. Launch Complete System

```bash
# Start the full WolfCog AGI-OS with all components
python3 wolfcog-coordinator.py
```

This will start:
- Symbolic spaces (u/e/s) with memory structures
- Ecron task scheduler with feedback loops
- Admin and Director persistent agents
- Scheduler and Reflex daemons
- Task processing pipeline

### 3. Test Symbolic Operations

```bash
# Create symbolic tasks for processing
echo '{"flow": "test_cognition", "space": "e", "symbolic": "∇(cognitive_pattern)", "action": "evolve"}' > /tmp/ecron_tasks/test.json

# Monitor task processing
ls -la /tmp/ecron_tasks/
```

## Core Components

### Wolf Kernels

- **WolfCore**: Central symbolic microkernel with macro evaluation and state management
- **WolfNode**: Guile-based execution nodes for distributed symbolic processing  
- **Ecron**: Tensor-based symbolic scheduler for complex task flows
- **Meta Shell Walker**: Self-modifying shell system with recursive capabilities

### Integration Layers

- **LibraryLinkUtils**: Connects Wolfram Engine to C/C++ codebases and AtomSpace memory
- **GitLink**: Enables AGI self-modification through automated code repository management
- **CascadeLink**: Multi-layered evaluations with rollback/fork capabilities

### System Services

- **Scheduler Daemon**: Runs Ecron and coordinates symbolic flows across spaces
- **Reflex Daemon**: Monitors shells and self-modifying symbols for reactive responses  
- **Services Daemon**: Handles GitLink, Cascade operations, and runtime triggers
- **Admin Agent**: Persistent monitoring agent for system health and optimization
- **Director Agent**: Logical reasoning agent for system coordination and inference

## Design Philosophy

WolfCog implements a cognitive architecture where:

- **Code is Cognition**: Programs embody understanding and reasoning patterns
- **Tasks are Manifold Flows**: Computational tasks flow on mathematical manifolds
- **Memory is Geometric**: Data structures organized as navigable geometric spaces
- **Evolution is Recursive**: System continuously improves through self-modification
